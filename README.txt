We both worked in parallel, and one of us was usually around while the other was coding, just to discuss ideas. 
Kevin contributed the most to the minimax ideas and coding, while I worked on the board, finding the heuristics, 
and did a lot of debuging code. I think we did probably the same amount of work roughly. 

Improvements: We added some cool heuristics that we found from papers online. We wanted to add a metric of stability
as well but we didn't understand the paper well enough to do so. I think these strategies will definitely have a positive effect. 
Our current algorithm prioritizes corners above all else, which I think is incredibly important in this game. Furthermore, there are 
certain squares that we just won't try to get. Our minimax algorithm appears to work pretty well at picking the right move as well.
